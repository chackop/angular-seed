# Weather App

This project is an application to monitor the 5 day weather forecast for London. 
It is the first iteration which is based on application skeleton from angular seed app. 
It also is mobile responisve which is achieved using bootstrap.

## Functions

Currently the app uses a registered controller that gets the data based on the unique open weather API Key.
Then this data is stored in a scoped object which is used in the view level.
In the view level, ng-repeat is used to iterate through and display the basic data list.
Bootsrap grid classes are also used to make the specific panels responsive

### Future Enhancements

Some of the key enhancements for future iterations include:
Use custom directives so that it can be applied with multiple cities
Apply options to switch between units
Usage of font vector icons (within the weather data)
