# Weather App

This project is an application to monitor the 5 day weather forecast for London. 
It is the first iteration which is based on application skeleton from angular seed app. 
It also is mobile responisve which is achieved using bootstrap.

## Functions

Currently the app uses a registered controller that gets the data based on the unique open weather API Key.
Then this data is stored in a scoped object which is used in the view level.
In the view level, ng-repeat is used to iterate through and display the basic data list.
Bootsrap grid classes are also used to make the specific panels responsive

Some of the key enhancements for future iterations include:
Use custom directives so that it can be applied with multiple cities, 
Input to search by city, id or co-ordinates and apply validation, 
Apply options to switch between units and show extra info, 
Options to show generalised details per day and also options to show extra details per day,
